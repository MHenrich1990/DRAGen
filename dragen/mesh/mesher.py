"""From a voxel label field to a C3D10 mesh with smoothed, adaptively meshed grain boundaries.

    clean-up (M1) -> topology (M1) -> surface model (M2) -> smoothing (M3)
    -> adaptive remeshing of the grain boundaries (M4a) -> gmsh tetrahedra (M4)

Feedback: tetrahedra with a smallest dihedral angle below `min_dihedral` are almost always forced
by the surface (a grain locally thinner than its boundary triangles, a narrow wedge at a line, or
a slightly concave edge bridged by one flat element; process notes 7.12). Around them the surface
is remeshed further and the volume meshed again, one step of `feedback` per round: 'coarsen'
doubles the size field there so vertices are collapsed and the fine feature is simplified away
(author's proposal), 'refine' halves it down to h_min. What remains is reported.

Resolution: where h_max (a quarter of the grain diameter) is not above h_min for most grains, the
voxels are too coarse for the grain size; the mesh is made anyway and a warning is given.
